# Fishing-Minigame
This is a proyect for CCOM4440

This is a 2D arcade-style fishing game where the player controls a fisherman in a small boat, moving around freely and casting the fishing line in any direction. The player must catch different types of fish to earn points while carefully avoiding dangerous sharks that roam the waters.

The main objective is to achieve the highest possible score before the timer runs out or the boat takes too much damage. Friendly fish reward the player with points when caught, while predator fish (sharks) and falling obstacles can damage the boat on contact. As time passes, the game gradually becomes more challenging: fish and obstacles spawn more frequently, and sharks pose an increasing threat, forcing the player to balance risk and reward with every cast.
